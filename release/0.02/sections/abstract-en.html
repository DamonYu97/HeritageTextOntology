<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Heritage Text Ontology is designed to represent the knowledge in textual heritage. It describes a set of classes,
properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent content and metadata of digitised historical textual collections.
It can also capture the provenance information of digital contents and concepts. This helps to track not only the sources where
same concepts appeared, but also how textual data was digitised and extracted.
