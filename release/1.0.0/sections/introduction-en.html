<p>The Heritage Text Ontology is designed to represent the knowledge in textual heritage. This document describes a set of classes,
    properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent content and metadata of digitised historical textual
    collections, as well as the provenance information. </p>

<p>The rationale for this ontology: A large number of textual heritage has been digitised by various data providers,
    which provides a wealth of opportunities for advancing research in the fields of history, culture, and linguistics.
    However, the heterogeneous and scale of these digital archives makes it difficult for researchers to search and
    extract meaningful information. In this case, making digitised textual collections Findable, Accessible,
    Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) for both humans and machines is extremely important, and building this ontology
    is the fundamental step to achieve that goal as it shares the formal representation of the knowledge in this domain.
</p>

<p>Overall, this ontology will represent metadata (title, physical description, genre, editor, et al.) of documents,
textual content (original text, article, abstract, concepts such as people and place) of documents,
related provenance information (digitisation activity, software tools, editor, publisher, et al.) of the documents
    and the textual content, and relations among them. Also, this ontology links textual content with recognised entities inside it using <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#Annotation">annotations</a>.</p>

<p>Note that we only focus on the literal meaning of the textual content instead of the style how text was printed or written.
To represent all aspects of a handwritten text, please refer to <a href="https://cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/">CRMtex (Model for the study
        of ancient texts)</a></p>

<p>In previous versions, HTO was only able to represent textual content in either page level, or article level.
    We have extended HTO to represent recognised entities inside textual content,
    and link textual content with these entities.</p>
